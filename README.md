### GraphQL 
- Query Language for APIs 
- gives clients power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more 
- simplifies evolution of APIs over time 
- enables powerful dev tools 

### ApolloClient
- Query from UI (framework agnostic)
- processes query, requests data from GraphQL Server 
- GraphQL Server sends results of said query
- Apollo Client Normalizes and Stores Data 
- Then, the response is sent to UI and UI updates

## Why ApolloClient?
- Declarative data function
